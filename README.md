# COVID-19-Stats

## Welcome to the R Learning repository!
As part of my studies, I am taking emphasis on self-learning to learn a statistical analysis language. This program will take latest case numbers and draw a graph of cases vs deaths.

I will also look to add in a calculate for R0, using a simple model to estimate the R0 value of SARS-CoV-19.

This program is for educational use only.
